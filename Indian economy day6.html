        <b>sectors-of-indian-economy</b>  The Indian economy is one of the largest economies in the world. Given the population of the country, it is no surprise that its economy is so noteworthy, especially with regards to its various trade and distribution channels. But the Indian economy, as a whole, is an immensely complex topic to dissect, which is why it is effective to divide it. We divide it into three sectors- Primary, Secondary and Tertiary.

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_liberalisation_in_India">Economic_liberalisation_in_India</a>
    <p>The economic liberalisation in India refers to the series of policy changes aimed at opening up the country's economy to the world, with the objective of making it more market-oriented and consumption-driven. The goal was to expand the role of private and foreign investment, which was seen as a means of achieving economic growth and development.[1]<br>[2] Although some attempts at liberalisation were made in 1966 and the early 1980s, a more thorough liberalisation was initiated in 1991.<br>

        The liberalisation process was prompted by a balance of payments crisis that had led to a severe recession, dissolution of the Soviet Union leaving the United States as the sole superpower as well as the need to fulfill structural adjustment programs required to receive loans from international financial institutions such as the IMF and World Bank. The crisis in 1991 served as a catalyst for the government to initiate a more comprehensive economic reform agenda, including Liberalisation, Privatisation and Globalisation referred to as LPG reforms.</p>

    <p>Food security has been a major concern in India. In 2022, the Global Food Security Index ranked India at 68th out of the 113 major countries in terms of food security.<br>[1] In 2023, the Global Hunger Index ranked India at 111th out of 125 countries.<br>[2] According to United Nations, there are nearly 195 million undernourished people in India that make up a quarter of the world's undernourished population. In addition, roughly 43% of children in India are chronically undernourished.<br>[3] Though the current nutritional standards meets 100% of daily food requirements, India lags far behind in terms of a quality protein intake at 20%; this shortcoming can be alleviated by making available protein-rich food products such as soybeans, lentils, meat, eggs, dairy, etc. more readily accessible and affordable for Indian citizens.<br>[4] The Human Rights Measurement Initiative<br>[5] finds that India is operating at only 56.8% of its capacity based its economic power to ensure its citizens have adequate food security.[6]</p>
