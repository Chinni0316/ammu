            CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document.

            CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.

            <h3>What is CSS?
                CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
                CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
                CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
                External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

                CSS Solved a Big Problem
                HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!

                HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:

                   
                <h1>This is a heading</h1>

                    
                <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

                   
                When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.

                  
                To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.

                CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!
